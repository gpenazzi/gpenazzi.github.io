This is a list of the Scientific Softwares I contributed (or am still contributing) significantly to.

QuantumATK (Commercial)
===
[QuantumATK](https://www.synopsys.com/silicon/quantumatk.html) is an atomistic simulation framework developed aimed at industrial and academic customers. It contains a large number of simulation engines ranging from Plane Wave to Classical Force Field, orchestrated by a powerful GUI and python scripting. A detailed description can be found in our recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02794). I am contributing to QuantumATK since 2016.


DFTB+ (LGPL)
===

[DFTB+](https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus) is a quantum mechanical modelling software based on Density Functional Tight Binding. It provides a fast alternative to first-principle DFT calculations and it is therefore aimed at large systems.

libNEGF (LGPL)
===

[libNEGF](https://bitbucket.org/pecchia/libnegf/src) is a Fortran2008  library for Non Equilibrium Green's Functions. It can be used to solve efficiently open boundary conditions problems for quantum transport in devices.

Pyta (LGPL)
===

[Pyta](https://bitbucket.org/gpenazzi/pyta/src/master/) is a small Python package used for Non Equilibrium Green's function on model Hamiltonian. It is fully written by me in Python and I used it as a prototyping tool for libNEGF development.


TiberCAD (Commercial)
===

[TiberCAD](http://www.tibercad.org/) is a modular TCAD software for Multiscale/Multiphysics modelling of nanostructured devices. It is a commercial software but an open SDK to implement compatile modules is available.
