I am migrating my old google sites and wordpress page to github. I thought
that learning to blog with Jekyll would be more fun, and even at the
very beginning it seems that I was not wrong.

At least I can have code snippets in a nice way, and I put here one
as a reminder to my future self!

{% highlight python %}
def hello_world():
  print('Hello world!')
#=> That's what I call an hello world.
{% endhighlight %}
