Hi, this is a weblog about my professional history and interests.

My name is Gabriele Penazzi, an electronic engineer as education
and a scientific software developer as job and passion.
I am living in Bremen (Germany) and working as Software Engineer
in [Bruker](<http://www.bruker.com>).
 You can give a look to my research on
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=4CCZ3ecAAAAJ)
and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gabriele_Penazzi2/), or
download my [Resume]({{ site.github.url }}/resume/).

I enjoy device physics, quantum mechanics, coding in Python, C++ and Fortran.
