Hi, this is a weblog about my professional history and interests.

My name is Gabriele Penazzi, an electronic engineer as education
and a scientific software developer as job and passion.
I am working as postdoc in the Bremen Center for Computational Materials
Science. You can give a look to my research on
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=4CCZ3ecAAAAJ)
or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gabriele_Penazzi2/).

I enjoy device physics, quantum transport, coding in Python, C++ and Fortran
and possibly run code on large parallel machines.
